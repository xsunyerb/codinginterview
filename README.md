Coding interviews are getting tougher every day. A few years back, brushing up on key data structures and going through 50-75 coding interview questions was more than enough prep for an interview. Today, everyone has access to massive sets of coding questions that have even gotten more complex. The overall process has gotten more competitive.

When our team sat together to brainstorm ideas to make the interview process easier for candidates, we quickly realized that one skill helped us the most when we were preparing for coding interviews: "the ability to map a new problem to an already known problem."

To help candidates with that, we've come up with a list of 16 patterns for coding questions, based on similarities in the techniques needed to solve them. As a result, once you're familiar with a pattern, you'll be able to solve dozens of problems with it.
